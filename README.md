# AI-Chatbot-Agent-Development
To develop a sophisticated AI chatbot agent using cutting-edge AI technologies, I will provide a Python solution that integrates third-party APIs, ensures dynamic responses, and deploys a functional chatbot. The chatbot will utilize NLP models such as GPT (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3 or GPT-4) and integrate with other services like databases, weather APIs, or e-commerce data to provide rich interactions.
Key Requirements:

    Integration with third-party APIs (e.g., weather, news, databases).
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) using models like GPT.
    Real-time dynamic data responses to user queries.
    User input handling with context awareness and follow-up questions.
    Deploying the chatbot as a web-based application or within a messaging service (Slack, Telegram, etc.).

We'll use the following tools and libraries for this task:

    OpenAI API (GPT-3 or GPT-4) for NLP tasks.
    Flask or FastAPI for web server (optional, if you want to deploy the chatbot as a web application).
    Requests to handle third-party API calls.
    Database integration for storing conversation history (SQLite for simplicity).
    Logging to track interactions.

Python Code for AI Chatbot:
1. Install Dependencies:

Before running the code, install the required libraries:

pip install openai requests flask sqlite3

2. Bot Code:

import openai
import requests
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import sqlite3
import logging

# Set up logging for debugging and monitoring chatbot interactions
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Set up OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

# Third-party API example - Weather API
WEATHER_API_KEY = 'YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY'
WEATHER_API_URL = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather'

# Flask app initialization for web interface (optional)
app = Flask(__name__)

# Function to interact with GPT model
def get_gpt_response(prompt):
    try:
        # OpenAI GPT-3/4 API Call
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            model="text-davinci-003",  # Use the appropriate model
            prompt=prompt,
            max_tokens=150
        )
        return response.choices[0].text.strip()
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error interacting with GPT API: {e}")
        return "Sorry, something went wrong."

# Function to fetch weather information using OpenWeather API
def get_weather(city):
    try:
        response = requests.get(f'{WEATHER_API_URL}?q={city}&appid={WEATHER_API_KEY}&units=metric')
        data = response.json()
        if data.get('cod') == 200:
            return f"The weather in {city} is {data['main']['temp']}°C with {data['weather'][0]['description']}."
        else:
            return "Sorry, I couldn't fetch the weather for that city."
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error fetching weather data: {e}")
        return "Sorry, there was an issue fetching the weather."

# Function to save conversations into a SQLite database
def save_conversation(user_input, bot_response):
    try:
        connection = sqlite3.connect('chatbot_conversations.db')
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS conversations
                          (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, user_input TEXT, bot_response TEXT)''')
        cursor.execute('INSERT INTO conversations (user_input, bot_response) VALUES (?, ?)', 
                       (user_input, bot_response))
        connection.commit()
        connection.close()
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error saving conversation: {e}")

# Flask route to handle user interactions (web-based chatbot interface)
@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    try:
        user_input = request.json.get('message')
        if "weather" in user_input.lower():
            city = user_input.split('in')[-1].strip()
            bot_response = get_weather(city)
        else:
            prompt = f"User: {user_input}\nBot:"
            bot_response = get_gpt_response(prompt)

        # Save conversation in DB
        save_conversation(user_input, bot_response)

        return jsonify({'response': bot_response})
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error in chat endpoint: {e}")
        return jsonify({'response': "Sorry, I encountered an error."})

# Main function to run the Flask app (for web-based deployment)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation of Code:

    OpenAI Integration:
        The function get_gpt_response() interacts with OpenAI's GPT model (text-davinci-003) to generate human-like responses.
        The prompt sent to GPT is dynamically generated based on user input.

    Weather API Integration:
        The get_weather() function fetches weather information using OpenWeather API. It looks for the keyword weather in the user's message and responds with real-time weather data for the requested city.

    Conversation History:
        save_conversation() stores user inputs and bot responses into an SQLite database (chatbot_conversations.db). This ensures that all interactions are logged for future analysis.

    Flask Web App:
        The chatbot is set up as a Flask application for easy deployment as a web-based interface.
        The route /chat listens for POST requests, processes user input, and returns the bot's response as JSON.

Deployment:

    Run the Flask app: To start the Flask application and deploy the chatbot on a local server, run:

python chatbot.py

The chatbot can now be accessed via http://localhost:5000/chat by sending POST requests.

Sample Input & Output:

Request (POST) JSON:

{
  "message": "What's the weather in London?"
}

Response JSON:

    {
      "response": "The weather in London is 12°C with clear sky."
    }

Additional Enhancements:

    Advanced API Integrations:
        Integrate more APIs (e.g., news, sports, or custom business data) to further enrich user interactions.

    Conversation Context:
        Implement context management to keep track of conversations (e.g., store user preferences or past queries).

    Deployment on Messaging Platforms:
        Use libraries like python-telegram-bot or slack_sdk to deploy the chatbot on messaging platforms like Telegram or Slack.

    Voice Interaction:
        Use text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) APIs to enable voice-based interactions.

    User Authentication:
        Implement user authentication (e.g., login with Google) to personalize the experience and handle user-specific queries.

Conclusion:

This Python-based AI chatbot integrates cutting-edge NLP technology (OpenAI), third-party APIs (e.g., weather API), and dynamic conversation handling, providing an interactive and engaging experience for users. The system is easily extensible and can be deployed to different platforms with minimal modifications.
